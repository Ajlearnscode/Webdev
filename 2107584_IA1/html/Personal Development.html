                                            As a growing young man, there are quite a few strengths that i have developed over the years. In this writing I will
                                            speaking on 7 strengths that align with the book "Twelve Pillars". Those 7 strengths include, <mark><i><strong>Wisdom</strong></i></mark>. My life has always 
                                            been filled with trials, trouble and adventure. My life experiences have taught me how to be wise and it has also shaped
                                            the way in which I think, operate and move. The wisdom I have gained allowed me to be hungry for knowledge and success.
                                            My passion for learning and gaining wisdom has really increased over the years, thus making it one of my many strengths.

                                            <p>
                                                <mark><i><b>Curiosity</b></i></mark>, I believe that a curious learner makes an intelligent individual. a perosn that asks questions and dives deeper 
                                                for knowlege is destined for greatness once used correctly. As a child my curiosity continued to open up doors of oppurtunity 
                                                for me. Curiosity allows me as an individual to know the Whys and Hows to things. For example, as an individual who aspires to 
                                                be a Fullstack developer and Software Engineer, my curiosty pushed me to research on the different requirements of these fields,
                                                what they do, their relevance in today's society as well as what is it going to take for me to achive my goal.
                                            </p>

                                            <p>
                                                <mark><i><b>Open Mindness</b></i></mark>, I strongly believe that being open minded to views, opinions, facts, teachings and the wisdom of successfull
                                                individuals will allow me to achieve my goals. Even tho I may be openminded, it does not mean that every information that i recieve,
                                                I will absorb. As an individual that values learning, the informations that I recieved is tested, challenged and researched before it
                                                is believed. This strength and habit has allowed be not top be easily persuaded by individuals who intend to fool or mislead people.
                                                As young man having the additional strength of being steadfast in my beliefs, morales, values and standards, has allowed me to overcome
                                                social or peerpressure. In such present society, a strength as this is one that everyone should strive for.
                                            </p>

                                            <p>
                                                <mark><i><b>Peristence</b></i></mark>, goals, dreams nor plans will never be achieved without being persistent or having determination. My courage to push in spite of 
                                                my various circumstances has allowed me to be at the place in which I am today, also with the help of God. As mentioned before, my life is
                                                filled with adventure, many unforseen events and trials. The previous strengths that were mentioned all helped to build this strength. This 
                                                strength is always being exercised especially when the feeling of laziness kicks in. I know I have a set destination and goal and inorder to 
                                                reach to that level of achievement I must ensure that I remain persistence, hence it is one of my strengths. 
                                            </p>

                                            <p>
                                                In my process of maturity, I have always had an issue with controlling my anger. However, as growth took place, <mark><i><b>self regulation</b></i></mark> had allowed me 
                                                to learn how to control my behaviour, reactions and emotions. Self regulations also taught me how to analyze myself, self analysis has allowed 
                                                me to identify my strengths and weaknesses. The  ability to control myself has helped me to avoid different altercations, confrontations and 
                                                unecessary conflicts. I strongly believe that having this strength is a key factor in becoming successful and achieving the plan that I have set.
                                            </p>

                                            <p>
                                                Lastly, one of my strongest skill is <mark><i><b>adaptability</b></i></mark>. Over the years I have noticed that my ability to adapt to sudden change 
                                                has been incredible due to the experiences I had gone through. They have shaped my mindset, approach and behaviour to many things. I belive that on my 
                                                journey to success, being able to adapt to changes is one factor that makes a great leader. On the road to success there will be obstacles, failures and 
                                                unexpected cituations. However, being able to adapt and rise from a downfall quickly is one of my strongest, if not my most valuable strength.

                                            The Twelve Pillars was a great eye opening book. I have read from champters 7 to 8 and I believe that I gotten the chance to re-evaluate
                                             my mind and strategies to reach my final destination. Based on the chapters I read, there were two main characters, Micheal and Charlie.
                                             Micheal was a grown man with a  wife amnd children who worked hard to make a living each day. He was a representation average individual
                                             that we see on a day to day basis. However, there came a point in Micheal's life where he realized that there was much more potential that
                                             was hidden within him that had not yet been discovered. In Chapter 4 of the book "Achive your Goals", there were a few important take aways.
                                             In the text there was a character by the name of Sue, she was a very happy individual that had a great and warm attitude. The chapter mentions 
                                             of the "Gardening Method", this method was taught to Micheal by Charlie to assiste him with his relationship between him and his wife, Amy.
                                             Just as we have plants and they need constant care and maintanance, so are relationships. Charlie refers to relationships as being a garden. 
                                             You have to water the plants and ensure that they receiving adequate amounts of sunlight in order to live. In this chapter, Micheal is taught
                                             about goal setting. Charlie talks about the importance of having a goal and alsoe the importance of writing it down. According to Mr. Davis,
                                             when an individual is has a goal, it allows them to know what it is that they are working towards, what will it take for them to achive that goal 
                                             and that the main purpose of having a goal is for the process to transform you into becoming a better person. Secondly Charlie mentions to Micheal 
                                             that when a goal is set, the cognitive part of the brain realizes this and will begin to want to achieve said goals.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            In chapter 5, it speaks to the "Proper Use of Time". Time is limited and the saying goes that time that has bee lost, can never be regained.
                                            In the Twelve Pillars, it refers to two types of pain an individual will face in life, the first which is "The Pain of Discipline" and the second,
                                            "The Pain of Regret". In the passage Micheals talks about not having the time to reorder his steps to be where he wants to be, however, Charlie 
                                            explains to him that in order for him to reach his goals he first has to make time. Charlie stated and important fact by Mr.Davis about 
                                            not being slaves to time but being the master of time. Prioritizing and time management skills are necessary for an individual to achieve their goals.

                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            Chapter 6 of the book really stood out to me the most, "Surround Yourself With the Best People". often times we as humans fail to realize that the individuals 
                                            we associate with have a significant role in our lives. In the text Micheal mentions to Charlie about his friends, John, Clark and Tom; John is a retailer, however
                                            he fell out of school because of the dislikes he had of the system. Of the three freinds of Micheal, he seems to have a lot going on for him, though he hates his job but 
                                            stays there because he is trying to make a living. Secondly is Clark, he has been unemplyeed for a total of 2 years for two reasons, the inability to recognize
                                            something he likes or something that will pay the amount of money he wants to make. Tom on the other hand is a heavy and reckless spender who doesnt seem like the person who 
                                            would save a portion of what he has. Charlie was rather unimpressed by the type of friends that micheal had, he made it clear that the type of friends he associtated with have
                                            a huge impact on where he is today as well as the mindset he has. Charlie further went on to saying that he should assess his friends based on some queustions, in essence 
                                            if they did not contribute to the goal or  the perosn he wants to be, he needs to make the decision on whether to put them in three categories, disassociation, limited association or 
                                            expanded association. The individuals you associate with may impact you in ways that you wont even imagine. In the text, Charlie explains to Micheal that he needs to Surround
                                            him self with people which are of good substance, visions, qualities, values etc.. However, Micheal understood that he was not at the lace in which anyone of such value would 
                                            want to be his friend, Charlie stated to Micheal that in short terms, you have to become what you want, to attract the people of the same nature.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            The last chapter that was read was, "Be a Long Life Learner". Often times student who left from university or high school, believed that they have learned enough about life through 
                                            school. However, that is not really the case. While formal learning is good, self-learning is what really makes you become that individual you always wanted to be. According to the 
                                            text, learning is the beginning of many things such as health, wealth and spirituality. Charlie metioned that there are a few ways in which an individual can gain knowledge, through
                                            the reading of books, gaining knowlege from the people around you who are successful through observation and to constantly refelect on your life experience and analyze both which went 
                                            right and those which didn't. Michel was a man that dd not like to read, after hearing this Charlie was surprised and implored Micheal to read a book. Charlie mentioned to Micheal thats 
                                            its not what the book costs but what does it cost you if you dont read the book. The book that Micheal was given to read was "<i>The Magic of Thinking Big</i>".

                           The journey to success is not easy, it takes great determination and persistence to really reach at the level that you want to be.
                           Achieving my goals, I have learned from the book that an important key to being successful is to develop the right attitude, energy and
                            mindset. It is impoortant that I remain perpetual with these attributes to manifest imy imagination and goals intoa reality.
                            As it relates to the gardening method, I consider my self to be a garden which requires adequate amounts of care, investment, maintanance
                            time, energy and the lists goes on. Once proper time is invested into my self then new doors of opportunity will open as well as the
                            transformaton to be come the type of individual I want to be will take place. A crucial factor that i have noticed within the book is 
                            prioritizing what is most important. In my earlier years I was much of a time waster, I would usually play games all day without
                            taking the time out to read and gather knowledge. However, through the process of maturity, my realization for the need to time management
                            had kicked in. I have been developing over the years in this area, and I have seen a tremendous improvement in my academic performances 
                            as well as my productivity within the days. I believe that once I am able to master the art of time management, then i will be able to reach
                            my goal at a faster rate. When you invest in your self and achive things such as happiness, confidence and a peace of mind, this will positively 
                            impact and influence people around you. I call this the spill over effect.

                                As it relates to succcess, once you begin to have a taste of it, you must not stop from doing thr necessary things that helped you to
                                achieve such greatness. It wil constanly need you to have the right mindset, application, knowledge, attitude and application. Over the past 
                                3 years I have noticed my self continuously setting my goals, achieving some, removing some and ultimately setting them in a way where each one 
                                co-relates with one another. This has really forced my cognitive part of my brain to push my self to really achive the things i have set. My 
                                brain sees the goals, processes them and automatically thinks of my negative experiences and transfor the negative energy into positive energy. Now,
                                my negative past and experiences act as one form of motivations as to why I need to achieve that I have set. As Mr.Davis says, "Make a million 
                                dollars, not for the million dollars, but for what you will have to become to make that million dollars.", My ultimate goal of achieving my goals,
                                all related to self development. My ultimate goals of my goals is to be a great husband, father, rolemodel to my children, a leader and protector. All 
                                of which are possible throughout this journey.

                                Lastly, surrounding my self with the best people has been somthing that I recently started doing. On my journey to success and a new way of thinking,
                                I have noticed myself losing frienships. I must say that it does hurt, however, I have developed the attitude of acceptance. I no longer sit and 
                                be sad about losinga  close friend, I simply accept it for what it is for time lost can never be regained. I must confess that it gets really lonely 
                                when you shed the weight but it is all for a greater cause. As Charlie siad to micheal that inorder to attract what you want, you first have to become 
                                thats which you are trying to attract. Therefore, if i want to attract intelligent, attractive, brave, modest, successful, dedicated people, I must 
                                be so my self. Recently I have observed my self listening to motivation speeches from well known individuals, those include John Peterson, Robert 
                                Kiyosaki, Bishop Td. Jakes, Micheal Todd and Jim Rohn. It is  indeed correct that the people that you have in your life do havea an impact on your 
                                life. Once I began to surround my self with people that had the right mindset, my mind started to develop on a whole different level. Surrounding 
                                yourself with people who have the right attitude and move with a purpose, are great friends to have. Throught out my observation I have noticed that 
                                I have developed similar attributes as my father, he is a hard working young man that does what he has to do regardless of whats going in in his life. 
                                My father is my role model and from what I have learned is that, having someone thats is able to disect knowledge in to forms that is understandable by a child 
                                is someone worth having in your life. I have also noticed that teh energyu of those around you will over time latch onto you. When I realized this, I immediately 
                                began to analyze my self and the people who were in my extended association list.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Through my analysis I have went from speaking to over a hundred individuals on a day to day basis, to speaking to approximately 5 individuals. I noticed that a lot of 
                                the firends I had were comfortable being lazy, leaving easy lives and not willing to put in the worth to achive the goals they have set. Additionally, I had to significanlty 
                                reduce my communication with those individuals who were comfortable being depressed. I notice that when I was in my depressed state, their accpetance of depression
                                and not wanting to fight it started to come over me. Fortunately I went into isolation to regain myself from a loop hole, getting closer to God and inviting positivity in 
                                all areas of my life. Doing this on a day-to-day basis allowed me to significantly regain consciousnes. Surrounding my self with those who push you to become the best version
                                of your self are the type of people that I now associate with on a regular basis. Having the right attitude towards learning is the key to learning. Being passionate about knowledge
                                makes teh process if "knowing" much easier, and as charlie said, "Once the student is ready, the reacher will appear". Appying these strategies in my life even more will definitely allow 
                                me to achieve my goals at a faster pace.
